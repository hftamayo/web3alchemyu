1. My name is Herbert my discord's handler is halftamayo#1333 and my twitter is @heftamayo, I'm a web developer, my professional background includes PHP5 and Java EE application, since 2020 I'm working on the MERN Stack.

2. Since August of this year I'm trying to learn about Web3, specifically about Smart Contracts and Solidity, I want to complete each of the challenges from AlchemyU because I want to acquire the technical skills to work as a Blockchain Developer in a near future.

3. I finished the first version of this project on 10/28/2022 around 18:30

4. I used these technologies: Remix, OpenZepellin, Solidity

5. The most part I've enjoyed was the deployment process on OpenSea and Filebase

6. This contract may be used by: beginners in Smart Contracts and Solidity and Remix, public in general who wants a walkthrough of the process of coding and deployment of a Smart Contract.

7. I would like to recommend this project for newcomers in Web3, specially devs interested in Web3 technical stack
